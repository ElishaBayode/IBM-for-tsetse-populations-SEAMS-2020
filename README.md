# IBM-for-tsetse-populations-SEAMS-2020
This is a readme for my SEAMS 2020 workshop project. 
The repository contains all  relevant files associated with the Individual Based Model (IBM) for tsetse population. 

# Aim
The aim of this project is to apply all the good coding practices that I have learned during the first week of SEAMS to my IBM project, and to create an interface between R and NetLogo to allow more flexibility in the statistcal analysis of the model output. 

# Objectives
- Add comments to the NetLogo code to improve its readability  
- Install RNetLogo package in R to create an interface between R and NetLogo 
- Run several simulations in R and store outputs for statistical analysis
